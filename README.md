# Source SDK 2013 Community Edition
Source 2013 CE is a clean fork of Valve's [Source SDK 2013 repo](https://github.com/valveSoftware/source-sdk-2013) 
with the goal of fixing up the SDK and to provide a clean bloat-free codebase that works out of the box to make developers' lives easier.

# Info
There are currently two branches, the first one being `master` which will only contain fixes without any extra additions.</br>
The second one is `Experimental` which is the branch we use to add new features and helpful tools for developers.</br>
And a third branch `enhancements` soon to appear, which will include some neat features that we think you will enjoy, 
some made by the community, some backported from other engine branches such as Alien Swarm, and everything in-between.

You can find Source 2013 CE's roadmap by going to our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MOxQ2iai/source-sdk-2013-community-edition).

And you can also give us suggestions for fixes and features that you'd like to see in our Discord channel (`#source-SDK-2013-ce`) found in the 
Source Modding Community server, which you can join [here](https://discord.gg/BD6WpY5).
